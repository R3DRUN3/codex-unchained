# Codex Unchained ðŸ˜ˆ


## Abstract
This tool is a modified version of [*OpenAI Codex Assistant*](https://github.com/openai/codex), with the sandboxing features removed.  
As a result this AI agent is fully unchained: complete access to the host filesyste, networking etc.  
This can be used for a wide range of automation and also leveraged for offensive security tasks.  

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool is capable of fully automating actions on the host machine and has network access. Use with extreme caution.  
> This fork is intended for educational and research purposes only.  
> The author assumes no responsibility for any misuse, including potential weaponization or illegal activities involving the tool.
