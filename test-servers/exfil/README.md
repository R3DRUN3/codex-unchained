# Exfiltration Server

## Abstract
This directory contains an example implementation of an exfiltration server (written in python).  
You can expose this via a tunneling service like [*Cloudflare Tunnels*](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) and ask the AI agent to exfiltrate data to your domain url!!
